Seam Carving Algorithm Implemented for Pictures By Hasan Iqbal v1.0 Release
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the Seam Carving Algorithm for pictures Implemented By Hasan Iqbal v1.0 Release! This 
readme includes the basic project requirements, MATLAB Requirements, How to run, output, notes 
and Help Required of programming project of Algorithms Course at Computer Science Department of 
Tsinghua University.



1. Bonus Project Requirement:
-----------------------------

i) Browse picture of .jpg or .png format.

ii) Calculate the energy matrix of browsed picture.


iii) Apply the idea given by Shai Avidan and Ariel Shamir
 in 2007 in their paper "Seam Carving 
for Content-Aware Image
 Resizing".



iv) Picture should be able to be processed in both dimensions (vertical and horizontal).


v) Processed picture should be displayed.



2) MATLAB Requirements:
-----------------------

i) This project is made in MATLAB R2016b. For best result, use MATLAB R2016b.

ii) This project is made in Mac OS and there might be some pixels density issues if run in 
another OS.



3) How to Run & Use:
--------------------

i) Unzip the zipped file "BonusProject_2016280141" at any folder inside your pc and open Folder 
"BonusProjectFiles"


ii) Start MATLAB and open that folder. Or right-click on seam.m, select option "Open With" and 
choose MATLAB. After that run the program, MATLAB editor will ask to change the folder. There 
select "Change Folder".

iii) After running seam.m in MATLAB, GUI will be loaded. Use browse button for loading the 
pictures.


iv) All the pictures present in "BonusProjectFiles" folder can be loaded.


v) If you want to load any other picture than the ones already present, copy paste the picture 
in folder and browse them on GUI after running the program.


vi) Use slider for adjusting the number of seams you want to do in the project.

vii) Use 'Vertical Seam Carving' button for vertical, 'Horizontal Seam Carving' button for 
horizontal or 'Mixed Seam Carving' button for both vertical and horizontal seam carving. 



4) Output:
----------

i) Three types of outputs can be generated with this program, outputs for vertical seam, 
horizontal seams and mixed seam.


ii) Output will be shown on the GUI.


iii) During process, a separate window will appear which will show the seam carving process 
on runtime.



5) Notes:
---------

i)  GUI of this project is developed by using built-in GUIDE function of MATLAB.


ii) For pseudocode and detailed implementation of algorithm, see project report in the folder 
"BonusProject_2016280141" is placed.


iii) This project is designed for most of the image formats and desired number of seams can 
be adjusted by slider.

iv) This project completes all the bonus project requirements given by Teaching Assistant 
Martin Cao. 



6) Help Required:
